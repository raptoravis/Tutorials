// Now that we understand the basics of runtime polymorphism,
// let's return to our arkanoid clone example.

// We will define a base `GameElement` class, with a virtual
// update method and a virtual draw method.

// Game element types will inherit from this class and override
// the virtual methods to define their own behavior.

namespace InheritanceArkanoid
{
    struct GameElement
    {
        virtual void update(float mFT) {}
        virtual void draw() {}
        virtual ~GameElement() {}
    };

    // Now that we have defined a base class, we can define
    // the classes that inherit from this `GameElement`,
    // as we did in the animal example.

    struct Ball : GameElement
    {
        void update(float mFT) override { /* ... */}
        void draw() override { /* ... */}
    };

    struct Brick : GameElement
    {
        void update(float mFT) override { /* ... */}
        void draw() override { /* ... */}
    };

    struct Paddle : GameElement
    {
        void update(float mFT) override { /* ... */}
        void draw() override { /* ... */}
    };

    struct Powerup : GameElement
    {
        void update(float mFT) override { /* ... */}
        void draw() override { /* ... */}
    };

    // In the game class we can now store game elements in
    // the same container. Even if we'll be storing pointers
    // to `GameElement`, which is the base class, polymorphism
    // will make sure the correct overrides will be called for
    // each game element type.

    struct Game
    {
        std::vector<std::unique_ptr<GameElement>> elements;

        void update(float mFT)
        {
            for(auto& e : elements) e->update(mFT);
        }

        void draw()
        {
            for(auto& e : elements) e->draw();
        }
    };

    // Much better! The game class doesn't care about the
    // game element types anymore.

    // It is now much easier to implement a new game element:
    // modifying the game class is not required. Also, managing
    // interactions between elements and deleting "dead" elements
    // will be much easier with a single container.
}

int main() {}

// This approach, however, has a big drawback: this kind
// of design ("inheritance") does not allow "composition".

// By composition I mean begin able to create game objects
// by putting togheter several small components.

// Using this method you will end up with a big inheritance
// tree that makes sharing data and behavior between objects
// very difficult. Code repetition will be an issue.
// Here's an example:

/*
                    [ GameElement ]
                           |
        [ EnemyNPC ]----------------[ FriendlyNPC ]
              |							   |
     [ EnemyArmoredNPC ]         [ FriendlyArmoredNPC ]
              |							   |
  [ EnemyArmoredNPCWithGun ]  [ FriendlyArmoredNPCWithGun ]
*/

// As you can see, even though both friendly and enemy NPCs
// types may be armored or have a weapon, two separate
// inheritance tree branches have to be constructed to allow
// different combinations.

// This becomes cumbersome very fast, especially when there
// can be a lot of combinations.

// Wouldn't it be better to separate common behaviors and data
// in small components that objects could be made up of?

// Here's an example of a better design:

/*
    Components:
        [ NPC ]
        [ Enemy ]
        [ Friendly ]
        [ Armored ]
        [ WithGun ]
        ...

    Entities:
        [[ Skeleton ]]	= Enemy + NPC
        [[ Paladin ]] 	= Friendly + NPC + Armored + WithGun
        [[ Player ]] 	= Friendly + Armored + WithGun
        [[ Sniper ]] 	= Enemy + NPC + WithGun
        ...
*/

// Let's check out a possible implementation in the next
// code segment.
